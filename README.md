# SLIME (Systematic Lethal Interface for Messy Environments)

Slime is what we called our desktop pet. And by 'lethal', we mean it doesn't play around. Your files will disappear. That's right, gone. If you don't organize your stuff in folders and leave files scattered like trash in the root directory, Slime will eat them. No warnings, no second chances, no recovery, no trash bin. It sounds brutal but it has a point. Slime will make you learn folder discipline or suffer the consequences. From the moment files hit your PC, you either sort them or lose them. There is no going back.
