# SLIME (Loophole Hackathon)

Slime is what we called our desktop pet. It stands for **Systematic Lethal Interface for Messy Environments**. And by 'lethal', we mean it doesn't play around. Your files will disappear. That's right, gone. If you don't organize your stuff in folders and leave files scattered like trash in the root directory, Slime will eat them.
